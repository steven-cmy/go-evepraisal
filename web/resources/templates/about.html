  <h4>What is this?</h4>
  <p>This is a tool for Eve Online aimed at being able to quickly price check items in bulk. </p>

  <h4>What's new?</h4>
  <p><b>2018-03-04</b> - Update the styling to use bootstrap v4. Add link to the Google Sheets add-on.</p>
  <p><b>2017-11-13</b> - Add private appraisals, ability to delete appraisals, pagination for personal appraisal history, settings modal, non-persistent appraisals</p>
  <p><b>2017-09-16</b> - Added JSON endpoint for creating new appraisals and <a href="/api-docs">a page documenting the API endpoints</a>.</p>
  <p><b>2017-06-24</b> - The new version of evepraisal has the following improvements:
    <ul>
      <li>SSO - Login with your eve account</li>
      <li>No ads while logged in</li>
      <li>File uploads</li>
      <li>Item search / Single item view</li>
      <li>Prices generated from ESI data (more reliable and up-to-date)</li>
      <li>Paste anywhere on the page to fill the paste box</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h4>How are prices calculated?</h4>
  <p>Prices calculated from recent market data from Eve Online's ESI API. Items with low (or no) market volume use CCP's pricing estimates.</p>

  <h4>What does a purple row mean?</h4>
  <p>Purple rows are items that evepraisal had a hard time finding an accurate and current price for. This is usually caused by low (or no) market volume for that item.</p>

  <h4>What does logging in do?</h4>
  <p>Currently, logging in gives your own personal history of appraisals. It also removes the banner advertisemenet that is placed on the bottom of each page. I plan to add the ability to remove appraisals and more customization/settings that will be persisted with your user.</p>

  <h4>Caveats/Known Issues</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>There's no reliable way to get prices of blueprint copies (BPCs). Due to this, evepraisal doesn't even try to guess a price for them.</li>
    <li>Non-english formats don't always work properly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Is there an API?</h4>
  <p>Yes! A very simple one, but it will probably get you what you want. <a href="/api-docs">Click here to see the API Documentation</a>.</p>

  <h4>How do I contact you?</h4>
  <ul>
    <s><li>Send an in-game mail to: <a href="https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Magerawr" target="_blank">Magerawr</a></li>
